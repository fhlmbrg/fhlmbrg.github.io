On September 1stÂ the Norwegian Juniper Elite partner [nLogic AS](http://www.nlogic.no) hosted an event called &#8220;[Ansible i praksis](http://nlogic.no/kursogseminarer/367-nlogic-workshop-ansible-i-praksis)&#8220;, entirelyÂ focused on network automation using Ansible. Lots of interesting presentations and discussions fromÂ the Norwegian automation scene.Â A whole day of Juniper, automation and Ansible! Does it get any better?

I had the pleasure of leading a technical workshop at the end of the event whereÂ the attendees were challenged withÂ common operations tasksÂ worthy of automating.

A fun experience and all-in-all a greatÂ day!

### Presentations

[Juniper Networks](http://www.juniper.net) had the first presentation talkingÂ about their currentÂ automation portfolio and how they are embracing Ansible. Leading by example Juniper publishesÂ fully working playbooksÂ on Github &#8211;Â [github.com/JNPRAutomate](http://github.com/JNPRAutomate).

Next up was theÂ [Norwegian Meteorological Institute (MET)](http://www.met.no) talking about their Ansible implementationÂ and showcasing everything in aÂ live demo how theyÂ modify their Leaf-and-Spine DCÂ fabric including firewall rulesets, on the fly, of course.

Then [Uninett](http://www.uninett.no) showed how they are planning to roll out their new core network using Ansible and how they are saving loads of time by automating the initial preparationÂ ofÂ routers, before shipping them out to theirÂ educational and research institution partners.

### Workshop

The last part of the event was the two-hour workshop. The attendees got access to a nine-node Juniper QFX topology whichÂ they were challenged to interact with using only Ansible:

With the limited amount of time ourÂ main focus was:

  * Configure theÂ network infrastructure using abstraction and templates.
  * Perform an action on a device, then send that information to an external web service.
  * Export information from your infrastructure for inventory or compliance purposes.

Often it&#8217;s the small and simple tasks that yields the greatest automation value.

If you want to try someÂ similar scenarios, Juniper haveÂ published great examples on Github &#8211;Â [github.com/JNPRAutomate/ansible-junos-examples](http://github.com/JNPRAutomate/ansible-junos-examples) . You can spin up a two-node topology using [Vagrant](http://fredrikholmberg.com/2016/04/on-demand-juniper-labs-using-vagrant/)Â in minutes and start testing.

### So, what will YOUÂ automate this week?

Verifying NTP settings in your infrastructure? The planned cloudÂ deployment? The upcoming security compliance check? That single configuration change, that needsÂ to be typed in onÂ 100 nodes?

Start small and scale up later. The important key is that you startÂ automating something.

Unsure if your infrastructure is automation friendly? Need help finding some proper automation candidates? Fear notÂ &#8211; check outÂ my [consulting services](http://fredrikholmberg.com/consulting/).

Have a great day!Â ðŸŒŸ
