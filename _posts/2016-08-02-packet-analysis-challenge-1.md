Vacation&#8217;s over. Your networks have been underutilized for a good long month now. Time to get back toÂ the trenches.Â Why not start things off with a proper packet analysisÂ challenge? At least fire upÂ [Wireshark](https://wireshark.org/) to see if there&#8217;s an auto-update waiting for you?

<!--more-->

Thank you Netresec for providing [a huge list](http://www.netresec.com/?page=PcapFiles) of packet captures to play with!

We will borrow a 13 MB packet captureÂ from the excellent book &#8220;[Practical Packet Analysis](https://www.amazon.com/Practical-Packet-Analysis-Wireshark-Real-World/dp/1593272669)&#8220;.

Please go ahead and [download](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1185688/wireshark1.pcapng)Â the pcap file.Â Yes, it&#8217;s [safe](https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/1ec10a7f08ffe6e597f5ecde13c120003f75b8a96d6eb1680006f9b786406521/analysis/1470058599/) to download.

Ready?

### <gong sound>

Five questions + one bonus.Â One point per question:

  1. How many non-broadcast IPv4 nodesÂ is Wireshark seeing?
  2. The client downloads an EXE file, twice.Â From which countries is it downloading the file from?
  3. How manyÂ Bytes is the client expecting to download for each EXE file?
  4. Looking at the fastest of the two transfers, at what speedÂ is the file downloaded on average in kbps,Â kilobit per second?
  5. One node is not accepting the use of fullÂ TCP segments. Which one? 
      1. BONUSÂ &#8211; How many Bytes is the client potentially missing out on per round-trip?

### Easy peasy?

Please send me your answers via a communication platform of your liking. The [social medias](http://twitter.com/holmahenkel) or [email](mailto:mail@fredrikholmberg.com). Doesn&#8217;t matter!

The winner will get loads of street cred as defined by [Urban Dictionary](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=street%20cred):

> He&#8217;s been thru it all. His street cred is undeniable.

That&#8217;s all you need. Get to it! ðŸ‘Š
